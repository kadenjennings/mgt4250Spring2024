## Project description
### Questions of interest
  - Should you invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum?
### Importance Statement
  - This question is especially important because deciding between investing in Bitcoin or Ethereum is essential as it determines portfolio diversification and aligns with individual investment goals. Understanding the distinct characteristics, market dynamics, and historical performance of each cryptocurrency helps investors make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance and desired investment outcomes. This is a long standing debate as evidenced by these references

### Data Description

  - I got this data from kaggle at this link [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/bitcoin-and-ethereum-prices-from-start-to-2023). I then combined the bitcoin and ethereum datasets by date.
  - Adj Close: amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions. It is often used when examining historical returns or doing a detailed analysis of past performance.
  - Close: cost of shares at the end of the day
  - High: highest price at which a stock trades over the course of a trading day.
  - Low: lowest price at which a stock trades over the course of a trading day.
  - Open: the first executed trade price for that particular day. It is very likely that the open price will not be the same as the previous day's closing price.
  - Volume: the number of shares traded in a particular stock or other investment
  - Here are the two datasets that I used: 

### Interpreting Visualizations

  - Bitcoin V Ethereum Moving Averages v Adjusted Close: This visualization can give insights into the trend and volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Moving averages smooth out price data to identify trends over specific time periods, while adjusted close prices account for factors like dividends and stock splits, providing a more accurate reflection of a cryptocurrency's true value over time. By comparing these two metrics, investors can gauge the overall trend and potential long-term value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). 
    
  - Bitcoin V Ethereum Trading Volume v Price Volatility: By examining past trading patterns and projecting them into the future, investors can gain insights into potential price movements for both cryptocurrencies. This analysis helps investors make informed decisions about their cryptocurrency investments based on historical performance and market behavior.
    
  - Bitcoin V Ethereum Over The Next 30 Months: Comparing trading volume to price volatility can help investors assess the liquidity and stability of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Higher trading volume typically indicates greater market liquidity and investor confidence, while lower price volatility suggests a more stable investment opportunity. By analyzing these metrics side by side, investors can make informed decisions about which cryptocurrency to invest in based on their risk tolerance and investment objectives. A closer correlation between trading volume and price volatility indicates a more dynamic and responsive market environment where changes in trading activity have a stronger impact on price movements.


### Discussion & Summary

  - This article dives into which cryptocurrency you should invest in. They recommend Bitcoin due to Institutional Investor support
    
  - Here is what ChatGPT recommends: Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are leading cryptocurrencies with distinct characteristics. Bitcoin, often likened to digital gold, is renowned for its scarcity and store of value properties, making it attractive for long-term investment and hedging against economic uncertainty. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a versatile platform powering decentralized applications and smart contracts, offering broader utility beyond pure investment. If you seek stability and a proven track record, Bitcoin might be a suitable choice. However, if you're intrigued by blockchain innovation and potential growth opportunities, Ethereum could be more appealing. Ultimately, it's crucial to conduct thorough research, assess your risk tolerance, and align your investment strategy with your financial goals.
